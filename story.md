This became more than just story and more just writing down ideas

- Missons, as levels.
Infinite ammount of tries on each level/mission.
Some score thing for replayability.
Restart level from the beginning upon death

- Mission made up of multiple one screen rooms.
Loot rooms of some sort too.

- A leader of some sort driving you to go on these expeditions to kill random enemies.
Preferrably voice lines during game telling you what to do and random tidbits

- Keeping some sort of thing from each level as to purchrase upgrades

## Room functionality
Each level consists of a random number of rooms, one loot room and one boss room.
levelid/roomid.png and
levelid/roomid.json
both contain the neccesary info to make the level like enemies or for a boss room which boss we have there.
